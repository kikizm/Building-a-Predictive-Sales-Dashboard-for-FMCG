## üìÅ STAGE 1: Problem Statement
### Introduction
Business performance analysis is a key factor for FMCG (Fast Moving Consumer Goods) companies to remain competitive in a dynamic market. By conducting comprehensive analysis, companies can identify sales trends, measure the effectiveness of promotions, and evaluate the contribution of different sales channels and regional markets. In the FMCG industry, distribution speed, product pricing, and stock management play a crucial role in determining business success. By monitoring key indicators such as total sales, average unit price, and delivery days, companies can better recognize their strengths and weaknesses. The FMCG dashboard provides insights into daily sales patterns, performance comparisons between promotion and non-promotion periods, as well as sales distribution by channel, region, and product lifecycle stage. These insights enable companies to design more effective strategies to increase sales, optimize promotions, and ensure sustainable long-term business growth.
